Allows you to select the language used for the WordPress frontend and admin.

== Description ==

This plugin detects an .mo language files installed in your wp-content/languages directory.

The naming convention of the .mo files is based on the [ISO-639](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Language-Codes) language code (e.g. pt for Portuguese) followed by the [ISO-3166](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_chapter/gettext_16.html#Country-Codes) country code (e.g. _PT for Portugal or _BR for Brazil). So, the Brazilian Portuguese file would be called pt_BR.mo, and a non-specific Portuges file would be called pt.mo.

It's not always easy to track down .mo files but you could try the following links:

* [WordPress Language File Repository](http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress-i18n/)
